# COVID-19 Alexa Skill for Dubhacks 2020!

Our Alexa Skill about COVID-19 information accessibility utilizes Amazon Web Services and COVID-19 data APIs.

Team: Usman Moazzam, Mariya Haveliwala, Jane Tang, Aasiya Islam, Rafia Khatri

We followed the Blueprint Track and focused on the issue of information accessibility, looking at ways that people could more readily receive COVID-19 information.
We focused on informing the public by:
- utilizing COVID-19 health data metrics
- connecting people to the appropriate resources, and
- involving the technology that people already use.

**Ease of use** and **convenience** were our major focus points, so we wanted to bring our solution right into usersâ€™ living spaces.
This is where Amazon Alexa comes in. We developed an Alexa skill to increase information accessibility.
By using JavaScript, the Alexa Skills SDK, Amazon AWS, and an API with COVID-19 case data, we created a skill called **COVID Tracker** that parses input from the user and returns the number of COVID-19 cases in a particular city.

The Alexa Skill model works by
1. taking user speech input
2. processing the speech to determine the request
3. using our developed skill application logic to act on the request and return a response to the user.


 next steps would be:
- implementing the abSomeility for users to undergo a self-assessment of symptoms
- have additional recommendations and resources, such as testing locations, returned to them
-- this can be expanded to include other COVID related metrics, such as mask utilization information or location specific recovery rate

Thank you!
